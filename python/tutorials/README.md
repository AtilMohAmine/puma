## Run locally
Depending on how you installed PuMA, you might have to install the following dependencies into the
conda environment: 

    conda activate puma
    conda install -c conda-forge ipympl jupyterlab

To follow the tutorials, from the puma root folder run:

    jupyter lab

from this folder and then open the tutorial that you want to follow.
