    "# Tutorial: 3D Visualization\n",
    "In this tutorial we demonstrate the use of the 3D Visualization capabilities in pumapy. The 3D visualization is based on a coupling with paraview and VTK. Visualization can be performed on either raw tomography samples (each material phase is composed of a range of grayscale values) or segmented images (each material phase is a single grayscale value). Pumapy can currently produce volume renderings or contours. Examples of each visualization are shown below. "
