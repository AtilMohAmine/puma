    "A workspace is the datastructure at the basis of both PuMA and pumapy and it is basically a container for the material sample that you want to analyze. A workspace is made of little cubes, or voxels (i.e. 3D pixels), holding a value. This simple element definition (formally called Cartesian grid) allows for very fast operations. Inside a workspace object, two different arrays are defined: one called \"matrix\" and the other called \"orientation\". Both of these are nothing but a 3D Numpy array for the matrix (X,Y,Z dimensions of the domain) and a 4D Numpy array for the orientation (dimensions of X,Y,Z,3 for vectors throughout the domain). \n",
