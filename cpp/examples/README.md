# PuMA Examples

Examples to show how to use PuMA functions and data structures.

## Getting Started
Compile and install the project as specified in the general README.md. If the default installation option is followed, the examples are installed in the install/bin folder as the pumaX_examples executable

## Running Examples
To run all the examplesuites, the executable can be run with "all" as a command line argument. To run a specific example or example category, add one of the codes from the list below.

   - Example: "pumaX_examples all" runs all examples
   - Example: "pumaX_examples prim4" runs the fourth primitives example
   - Example: "pumaX_examples prim" runs all the primitives examples

To see a list of available examples and their codes, run the executable without arguments.
