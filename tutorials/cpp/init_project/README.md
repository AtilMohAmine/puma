# PuMA project example

This is a self-contained example that shows how to link and compile a cpp file to the PuMA C++ library. 
To be able to run this, you must have installed PuMA using the conda command explained in the main PuMA README.
This init_project folder can also be copied and pasted anywhere else, which can serve as a starting canvas for a project
linked to PuMA. 

You can run this project using: 

    conda activate puma
    ./make_run.sh

This compiles the code inside the puma_project.cpp file, and runs the executable that is created inside the build folder.
